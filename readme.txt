============
INTRODUCTION
============
HaloStatus is a script for querying Halo PC and Halo CE (Custom Edition) game servers and viewing real time game and player information.

============
INSTALLATION
============
Simply copy the files from the "Halo Status" directory to a folder on your server. No configuration required.

============
USAGE NOTES
============
To link to a specific server, you can add a hash to the URL. For example:
http://osvex.com/halostatus/#s=46.249.47.12:2332

If you wish to ensure that visitors cannot query other servers, open ajax.php and uncomment (remove the /* and */) lines 8 to 30 and optionally 
comment out the 'New Query' button from index.html.

============
PSDS
============
Some of the PSDs used to create the assets for the script can be found in psds.zip. If you wish to create new map images, use the template
provided in mapinfotemplate.psd.

============
JAVASCRIPT
============
If you wish to make changes to the Javascript, ensure you either uncomment out the individual files in index.html or update the
everything-min.js file.

REQUIREMENTS
============
Recommended server:
PHP 5+ with socket support enabled. See troubleshooting for further information.

Browser:
Javascript enabled.

============
TROUBLESHOOTING AND OTHER BITS AND PIECES
============
Q) My server isn't running PHP 5.
A) Time to upgrade! If that isn't an option, you can run the script in PHP 4 by switching the constructors to PHP 4 style (e.g. __construct() to ClassName()) and removing the access modifiers, replacing them with the 'var' keyword. You will also need to replace the FILTER_VAR function with a regular expression or remove the IP validity check.

Q) I'm receiving an 'operation not permitted' error.
A) It's likely that one or more of the socket functions have been disabled by the server administrator. If you are the administrator, you can view a list of disabled functions in your php.ini file under 'disable_functions'. To work around this problem, see below to enable legacy functionality.

Q) My server doesn't have socket support enabled.
A) You can enable legacy functionality that works in a similar fashion to older query scripts. 
To do this, open script/ajax.php and change the following line:
$query = new QueryServer($buffer, $_POST['ip'], (int) $_POST['port']);
to:
$query = new QueryServer($buffer, $_POST['ip'], (int) $_POST['port'], null, 1);

It should be noted that this functionality is extremely slow as it will take the length of the specified timeout (default two seconds) to return a response. To lower the timeout, change the fourth argument to a suitable value (one second recommended for legacy functionality):
$query = new QueryServer($buffer, $_POST['ip'], (int) $_POST['port'], 1, 1);

Q) I keep getting 'no reply received' when I know the server is up.
A) It's possible that your server's configuration is blocking outbound and/or inbound data. Due to the nature of UDP, you will not receive any 'unable to connect' errors.

Q) The script is occasionally reporting 'no reply received' but otherwise works.
A) It's possible that the route between your server and the game server is experiencing high packet loss or high latency. If high latency is a persistent issue with your server, you can adjust the script's timeout by editing script/ajax.php.
To do this, open script/ajax.php and change the following line:
$query = new QueryServer($buffer, $_POST['ip'], (int) $_POST['port']);
to:
$query = new QueryServer($buffer, $_POST['ip'], (int) $_POST['port'], 5);

The above example sets a 5 second timeout.

Q) Is there any way to retrieve the raw game server response?
A) In script/ajax.php, $buffer will contain the raw server response.

Q) I've read all of the above but the script still doesn't work or I've found a bug.
A) Sorry/oops (delete as appropriate). Drop me an email on scriptsupport 'at' osvex.com (replace the 'at' with an @ sign) and I'll see what I can do.

============
BANDWIDTH USAGE
============
Using the default settings, this script will require around 250 bytes/sec (<1MB an hour) from a full server and around 150 bytes/sec from an empty server. This transfer rate should have a negligable impact on the server.

A little more demand is placed on web server due to the data being decoded from flags to strings and HTTP overhead but it's still only around 1KB/sec (guesstimate) for a full server.

If you deem this bandwidth usage to be too great, you can reduce the usage by editing the index.html file to decrease the polling rate.

CHANGELOG
